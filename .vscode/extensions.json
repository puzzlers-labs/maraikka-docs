  // Extension Selection Rationale
  // This minimal set of 3 extensions provides maximum value with minimal overhead
  // Each extension serves a specific purpose for documentation development
  //
  // Excluded Extensions
  // Many common extensions are intentionally omitted to keep the setup lightweight
  // Contributors can install additional extensions based on personal preference
  // The core functionality for documentation work is covered by these 3 extensions
